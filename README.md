## NextJS 13 Auth

<p>JWT stands for JSON Web Token and is a standard for securely transporting a user's login information (for example, username and password). These tokens are shared between the server and the client, and the server authenticates using the client's token.

To perform JWT authentication with Next.js 13, you first need to use a JWT library. These libraries help you to generate the user's login information as JWT token, send these tokens to the server and the server validates the token.

There are many JWT libraries available, but the most popular ones you can use with Next.js 13 include jsonwebtoken, jsonwebtoken-next, and next-auth. Using these libraries, you can easily perform JWT authentication in your Next.js application.</p>
